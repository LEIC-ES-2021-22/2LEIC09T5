# SECOND ITERATION RETROSPECTIVE

The second iteration was not as good as the first one. Work from other subjects slowed down development and not everything that was planned was done in this iteration. Nonetheless, some progress has been made and it is important to take a look at what was done and what could have been done.

## WHAT WAS DONE / WENT WELL

- We closed 4 issues this iteration: 2 of them were related to 1 main issue which is still in progress (creation of main menu widgets, 2/3) and the other two were resolved with two main pull requests, concerning the optimization of page rendering when it is updated and the absence justification procedure, whose user story we completely closed.
- 1 issue moved to the iteration backlog: regarding class exchange requests. It's the next big one we plan on tackling soon.
- Communication remained consistent throughout the iteration, although to a lesser extent since not as much work was done due to the reason already explained above.

## WHAT WENT WRONG

- Unfortunately, the other issues that were already in progress were not fully finished, and there is still one issue in the product backlog, which has to be done in the next and final iteration.

## ACTION ITEMS

- Manage our time more efficiently and distribute work through the group members in order to facilitate progress.
- Finish the issues that were in progress since the beginning of the last iteration and then focus of the remaining backlogged issues.

Even though this iteration was inferior to the last one, the group is still determined to deliver a good product with its final iteration and will continue to work with that goal in mind.
