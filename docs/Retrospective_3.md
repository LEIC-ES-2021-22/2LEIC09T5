# THIRD ITERATION RETROSPECTIVE

The third and final iteration was an improvement in relation to the last one, considering the amount of deadlines and deliveries the group had and still has other than this application.

## WHAT WAS DONE / WENT WELL

-  We closed 6 issues with 5 pull requests during this iteration, which were related to the absence justification main menu widget (the last out of the three in the creation of main menu widgets issue, that was also completed because of it), the update of the certificates page when new ones are created, the creation of a main/secondary page for class changes and the addition of Gherkin tests for certificates.
-  Another independent pull request was fulfilled, improving acceptance tests - sometimes we need to look back at our progress and try to find sections that could use a quality enhancement.

## WHAT WENT WRONG

- The user class exchange user story will not be complete, nor will the secretariat class exchange validation interface. The former was almost done, but the amount of work we had over the past few weeks, not only in this subject, has been overwhelming and it's not easy to manage. The latter implied making a number of changes that we initially did not consider (especially since we didn't know how the integration with UNI would work right off the bat) and was deemed too ambitious for a project of this scale.

## ACTION ITEMS

- Since this is the last iteration, nothing of significance can be added. This doesn't mean we won't revise everything to ensure that the delivery goes as smoothly as possible and our best work (given the restrictions) is shown.

Looking back, this project was a good way of implementing Software Engineering practices and getting used to work as a team. Perhaps with some more time and less pressure from other subjects, it could have been even more rewarding, but we are satisfied with our work and are grateful for the experience.
