# FIRST ITERATION RETROSPECTIVE

The first iteration was far from disappointing, although we felt like we could do better.


## WHAT WAS DONE / WENT WELL

- We were able to close four issues in two pull requests, which involved the display of declarations and the display/request of certificates. 
- 2 issues are still in progress: the update of the certificates pages upon creation of a new certificate and the absence justification procedure. 
- Finally, the last two issues, regarding class exchanges (management of the requests by the secretariat workers and creation/verification of requests by the students) are still resting on the Product Backlog.
- Naturally, testing was properly taken care of using Gherkin.
- The group is communicative and is always up to speed on any progress made by a certain member or a smaller group of members, depending on the task assignment.

## WHAT WENT WRONG

- The major difficulty we encountered was the comprehension of the UNI app codebase: 
Integrating our pages was not as straightforward as we expected, probably due to some members being unfamiliar with the Flutter and Dart technologies and having different approaches to code structuring between the UNI app developers and our group.
- The distribution of tasks could have been better, might have cost us some progress.

## ACTION ITEMS

- In the next iteration, we will work on improving the distribution of work between members in order to accelerate development and obtain a near-optimal value out of it. 
- Focusing on finishing the ongoing issues will be our top priority, while also starting the remaining two issues as well.
- Continue analyzing the UNI app codebase in order to understand it better and making our code more adequate and consistent with the existing one.

Despite the initial codebase comprehension issue, we adapted to the challenge and were able to deliver our first iteration that, while not being the ideal one, is still a solid foundation for releases to come.
