## Vision Statement

### To bring some of SIGARRA's most hidden features to light.

Accesing some documents in SIGARRA can be a confusing and slow process, our goal is to ease the pain of doing so by integrating these features in UNI.
Targetted at students who need to justify their absences or request certificates, secretaNIa is the solution.

## Main Features

secretaNIa will feature:
 - Absence justification - Automatically generate and send emails to the correct department managers to justify absences;
 - Declarations - Access all of the declarations available in SIGARRA;
 - Issue Certificates - Issue new certificates directly from UNI;
 - Checking Certificates - Verify the state of issued certificates and get notified about updates.

## Assumptions and dependencies

Most of our information will be retrieved from SIGARRA:
 - Student's Information - Course and year in which they are enrolled;
 - SIGARRA's Services - Interact with SIGARRA's services that concern certificates and declarations.
