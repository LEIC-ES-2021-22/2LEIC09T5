## Product Vision

### Vision Statement

---

To bring some of SIGARRA's most hidden features to light.

Accesing some documents in SIGARRA can be a confusing and slow process, our goal is to ease the pain of doing so.
For the student who needs to justify their absences or the student that needs their certificates, UNIon is the solution.

### Main Features

Including:
 - Absence justification - Automatically generate and send emails to the correct department managers to justify absences;
 - Declarations - Access all of the declarations available in SIGARRA;
 - Issue Certificates - Issue new certificates directly from UNI;
 - Check on Certificates - Verify the state of issued certificates and get notified about updates.

### Assumptions and dependencies

Will be dependant on:
 - Student's Information - Course and year in which they are enrolled.
